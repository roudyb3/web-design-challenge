    <p> As expected the weather becomes signficantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude).
        More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year
    than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year this data was gathered. </p>
